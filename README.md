As practice for learning and using grid I created this admin dashboard page using the skills I've learned in html and css, and also a little bit of javascript. 

First, I wrote out the html content. Once I decided on the layout, I moved the items around using grid until the layout was how i wanted it. Once I was satisfied with the layout I added other styles, such as colors, and I also added a small bit of functioning to make all of the links click-able.
